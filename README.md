# MineStats
Discord bot that checks the status and population of your Minecraft server.

### Installation and Set-up
Download the master and extract the contents into a folder on the computer/server you intend on using to host your bot.
Fill the following lines from the `config.json` file:
```
{
    "prefix":"-",
    "token":"YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
    "ip":"YOUR MINECRAFT SERVER IP"
}
```
Once you've changed the `token` and `ip` variables, you can now start your bot.
